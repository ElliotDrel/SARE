Below is a features-only PRD for the SARE website, focused on user experience, functionality, and concepts.

Title

SARE, Strengths in Action Reflection Experience, features and concepts PRD. The goal is to help a person collect positive stories from people who know them, reflect on those stories, and receive a clear strengths report. The name SARE was confirmed in Meeting 2\.

Product objectives

\* Make story collection simple, encouraging, and trackable.

\* Keep the process structured and calm, from first visit to final report.

\* Preserve research credibility, while avoiding RBSE branding on the site. Link out to research instead.

\* Offer a reflection step before any stories are revealed to the user.

\* Provide optional AI supported analysis and coaching ideas after collection.

Primary audiences

\* Primary user, the person requesting stories about their strengths.

\* Storyteller, the invited person who submits one or more stories.

\* Admin, a lightweight role for oversight and support.

Information architecture and navigation

\* Public pages, Home, About, Research, Sign in, with a clear call to action at the top and another sign in at the bottom of the home page. Research links to the underlying studies, the SARE site itself does not carry RBSE branding. 

\* Authenticated workspace, a persistent timeline banner shows progress through the process and permits moving back when helpful.

\* Help surfaces, short tips and examples on every key screen.

End to end journey

\* Learn and prepare. The user sees a brief explainer, who to ask, and how to ask them. The banner marks this stage complete when the user proceeds.

\* Collect stories. The user adds contacts, sends requests, tracks responses, and follows up. The system shows progress and nudges on timing.

\* Self reflection. Only after a target number of stories is reached, the user answers guided questions about strengths, evidence, and growth themes.

\* Strengths report. The site compiles the self reflection and all received stories into a single report the user can review and keep.

Key rules and guardrails

\* The site may link to research, but it does not use RBSE branding.

\* The user cannot read collected stories until the defined collection goal is met and the reflection step is complete.

\* Default collection goal is ten stories, this can be adjusted by the user within an allowed range.
