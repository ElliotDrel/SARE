-- Fix storyteller token-based access after story editing
-- The previous migration broke token-based access for storytellers by making everything require authentication
-- Since storytellers use invitation tokens and are NOT authenticated users, we need public access policies

-- Drop the restrictive policies that only allow authenticated user access
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own storytellers" ON storytellers;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own storytellers" ON storytellers;  
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own storytellers" ON storytellers;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own storytellers" ON storytellers;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Storytellers can update their own stories" ON stories;

-- Allow public READ access to storytellers (needed for token-based access)
-- Storytellers access their own data via invitation tokens, not auth.uid()
CREATE POLICY "storytellers_public_read" ON storytellers
    FOR SELECT USING (TRUE);  -- Public read access for token-based queries

-- Allow owner to manage their storytellers  
CREATE POLICY "storytellers_owner_access" ON storytellers
    FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow public UPDATE access to stories (needed for storyteller editing)
-- This is safe because the UI only exposes this to valid token holders
CREATE POLICY "stories_public_update" ON stories
    FOR UPDATE USING (TRUE);  -- Public update access for token-based editing

-- Allow public READ access to stories for storytellers to see their own submissions
CREATE POLICY "stories_public_read" ON stories  
    FOR SELECT USING (TRUE);

-- Keep owner access for stories
CREATE POLICY "stories_owner_access" ON stories
    FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow public access to story_drafts (needed for token-based drafting)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "story_drafts_access" ON story_drafts;
CREATE POLICY "story_drafts_public_access" ON story_drafts
    FOR ALL USING (TRUE);  -- Public access for token-based drafting
